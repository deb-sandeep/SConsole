* What happens when we overshoot a burn completion date?

* Offline session adding should refresh the 
    - burn chart for the study screenlet if the topic is currently being displayed
    - L30 days chart
    - Fragmentation chart
  
* Overflowing sessions - sessions which span beyond the 23:59:59 boundary
  should be reflected in fragmentation and day burn charts
  
    - While scooping todays sessions, logic needs to be changed to pick up
      overflow sessions on both ends
      
    - L30 charts now need to start accounting for overflow sessions in both
      days
      
  
* A web UI for burn completion readjustment. Should take care of streams
  and cascading changes

* A separate screenlet which should show the problem landscape of the
  given topic. Which problems are activated, solved, redo ed etc

* @Session play/start - make an entry in the database so that we have a
   concrete session against which laps can be added.
    - The end time will be null
    - End time will be populated at every problem end and again at stop
        This will ensure resilience against failures
        
* @Session stop - Set the session id to null so that at next play a new
   session will be created.
